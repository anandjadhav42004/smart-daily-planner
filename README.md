## 📘 **Why this Stack?**

This project uses the popular **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), which is ideal for full-stack JavaScript developers. It provides:

* A responsive frontend
* A RESTful backend API
* Persistent server-side storage
  Similar MERN planner apps also follow this pattern with CRUD task operations and backend persistence.
